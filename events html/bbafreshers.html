Swag_wali_Ramayan 
             At some point of our lives, we all have heard or watched Ramayan. Sometimes it was TV shows like one on DD, sometimes it was through stories of grandma, sometimes some spiritual Guruji while explaining life quoted a story from it. Ramayan and itâ€™s iconic characters are always close to our hearts but what if the entire story takes place today? What if Ram acts like some politician, what if Sita behaves as some television actress, What if Hanuman uses Whatsapp to contact fellow monkeys ? With this fanatical idea, Pantomime presented #Swag_Wali_Ramayan in the Institute Freshers.
          Bringing out hearty laughters from each person in crowd was our main aim in this play and we started doing it right from the dramatic disclaimer to the play. Crowd went crazy on seeing their mythological legends in a completely different avatar. The entire play was filled with some humorous scenes like Kaun Banega Ayodhya ka Raja ( KBAR) with King Dashrat as Amitabh Bachchan. Ram, Laxman, Sita playing PUBG in Vanvas was another such scene. The entry of Hanuman took the play to just another level. A fight sequel between Hanuman and Ravan was a dramatic beauty and the GOT Style death of Ravan was the cherry on the cake.
         You would have read and watched many versions of Ramayan but ours is definitely worth trying.
