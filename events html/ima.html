Odyssey: an epic journey.
Based on the theme “Sci fi odyssey” NIT Rourkela acknowledged its techno- management fest INNOVISION for the year 2k18. On the opening day of this fest, the official dramatic club of NITR, Pantomime performed a mime act for the same. The gang was ready and assembled for the task. The club opted to show the entire human evolution and hence the innovation of science and technology. 
The thing about mime is that it seems pretty much easier to display, but to unveil the wholesome journey of mankind without any props and dialogues was something out of the box. But via picturesque use of expressions, actions and music all combined, the club presented one of the best mime act. The act was well choreographed and presented. The club members beautifully portrayed invention of fire, wheels and electricity. We even showcased the unfaithful direction towards which our untidy development is taking the present generation with some touch of humour.
Ah, Merlin’s beard. It was a great experience overall and the BBA audience was amazing as always.
