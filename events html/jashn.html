Stage plays are the best ways to depict an abstract idea  in an interesting and meaningful way. It is a collaborate art combining different people into one group irrespective of their differences.
Keeping in view the beauty of the stage play our club Pantomime performed a magnificent play 'One last time' on the propitious occasion of the final years' farewell 'Jashna'.

The play captivated the journey of a student from it's first year to the final year. It revolved around the different phases of life that a student undergoes during these golden years.

The play was performed by the enthusiastic members of the club under the able guidance of the seniors. Many final year students also re-lived their moments by being a part of the play. The play ended with a glorious dance performance by the final years of the club.

It was one of the indelible stage plays of the club which will be known for years
