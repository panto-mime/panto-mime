  On the auspicious occasion of the 72nd Independence Day of our country, Pantomime got a chance to perform at the Independence Day celebrations held at the jam-packed BBA. Esteemed dignitaries, professors and students of the institute were present at the celebrations to increase its grandeur. Pantomime chose to perform a mime act and based their act on showcasing the challenging life of an Indian soldier. The Indian soldiers are the supreme protectors of your country who put their life and comfort at stake so that we can enjoy the coziness of the sweet cocoons of our home. Pantomime’s performance was an ode to these brave men. The mime act was very well scripted and systematically showcased the various hurdles that a soldier faces in the difficult path which he has chosen. It started from the very beginning of the soldier’s life and emphasized on social values like friendship, love and sacrifice. It showed how a child who is inspired and is determined to serve his nation leaves his family and loved ones to undergo vigorous training, undertakes a tough selection process and gets chosen for protecting the nation even at extreme conditions, always ready to sacrifice his life. The young and talented performers of the club played their assigned roles in a synchronized and regulated manner to produce a brilliant performance. All the gimmicks were made quickly and efficiently without any delays. Some scenes of the play moved the audience to tears and were later appraised a lot. The technical aspects of the play were also managed very efficiently by the club members and the proper lights and sound added to the essence of the play. Overall, the actors performed the play with full energy and exuberance. The audience rose to a standing ovation and praised team Pantomime for making it such a memorable one. The play left a strong message and an impact on the minds of the audience
